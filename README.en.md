> ROUNDED MODULE · SOURCE COLOUR · ISOMETRIC DEPTH · MATTE TOUCH · EDITORIAL MICROTYPE

Distinctive volume, axes, curves, interlocks, overlaps, occlusions, and negative spaces become rounded tactile modules in a gentle isometric sculpture, coloured only from the source's own visual memory.

## Why this Skill exists

The style is source-dependent, not a decorative preset. Its operative transformation is:

```text
analyse volume, axis, curves, overlap, and negative space → preserve three defining cues → simplify into rounded modular masses → compose through stacking, nesting, crossing, suspension, and source-earned misalignment → translate source colour into lighter cleaner healing hierarchy → render tactile matte pulp, wood, wax, or soft material → integrate microtype with seams and axes
```

If an unrelated photograph could replace the source without materially changing recognition, construction, placement, material, colour, whitespace, and copy, the result does not belong to this Panel.

## The visual contract

- Preserve at least three cues across overall volume, proportion, axis, curve, pose, direction, overlap, occlusion, opening, negative space, or relation.
- Use rounded, simple, tactile modular masses with real isometric depth. Stack, join, nest, cross, float, or gently misalign them according to source structure, not mechanical exploded parts.
- Analyse the source's lively principal colours, temperature, value hierarchy, warm-cool response, and key accent; translate them into lighter, cleaner, airy healing colour without importing absent hues or a fixed palette.
- Build rhythm through principal colour area, supporting layers, related value steps, and one tiny lively accent: gentle but energetic, playful but not sugary.
- Use matte diffuse tactile material suggesting paper pulp, wood, soft wax, chalk, or flexible composite, with rounded edges and light shadows; reject glossy plastic, metal, heavy CG, and cheap toys.
- Use scale, height, depth, local suspension, density shifts, and whitespace to create one sculptural focus rather than a full toy scene.

Complete aesthetic constraints and rejection rules live in the Skill and production prompts. They preserve the original brief without turning its historical 3:4 canvas into a hidden default. [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) · [production prompt](references/xxd-panel-045-prompt.en.md)

These samples demonstrate the 045 aesthetic motive. Their subjects, composition, palette, copy, and earlier canvas ratio never become generation references or current defaults.

## Four combinable output modes

Choose one or several modes with `1`, `1+3`, `1,2,4`, or `all`; `all` produces seven separate PNGs per source. After mode selection and before generation, the Skill explicitly asks for the whole finished canvas: the original-prompt `3:4`, an explicit source-aspect choice, a common ratio, or custom ratio/exact pixels. Source dimensions are never applied silently.

| Mode | Canvas rule | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `top-bottom` | user-confirmed whole canvas | one complete generation: high-fidelity source above, 045 design below, approximately 50/50 |
| `left-right` | user-confirmed whole canvas | one complete generation: high-fidelity source left, 045 design right, approximately 50/50 |
| `design-only` | user-confirmed whole canvas | 045 design fills the canvas; source remains invisible |
| `wallpaper-pack` | confirmed per device | separate phone, iPad, desktop, and children's-watch PNGs |

Paired modes use the source as a high-fidelity edit/reference input and one complete style prompt to generate the finished composition directly, so photography, design, colour, light, typography, and meaning can cohere. Deterministic composition is fallback-only: after one targeted complete-canvas retry fails, when pixel-identical source preservation is explicitly required, when the active route cannot realise the canvas, or for lossless final pixel calibration.

Wallpapers may be linked or independent. A linked pack approves one iPad anchor, then recomposes every other device from the original plus that same anchor. An independent pack gives each device only the original. Neither crops another device output nor chains derivatives.

## Copy and locale

Automatic copy, exact custom copy, or text-free output is confirmed before generation. Copy follows the intended audience rather than the command language, and exact user wording remains verbatim.

Project-specific copy rule: Use one two-to-five-word source-bound title plus only useful state, place, supplied number, direction word, or micro-note; do not use years. Align native microtype with module edges, seams, axes, negative space, overlaps, or occlusion so it becomes part of the sculpture's rhythm.

## Complete-canvas first, raster-only delivery

The image model owns the aesthetics of the entire finished composition; paired layouts also default to one complete-canvas generation. `scripts/compose_panel.py` remains only for condition-based recovery, lossless pixel calibration, and read-only audit. It is not run pre-emptively and does not judge aesthetic success.

Every deliverable is a raster PNG and every invocation creates a fresh task under `~/Desktop/xxd/`. The configured image route exposes sanitised status only—never providers, endpoints, credentials, headers, prompts, responses, or account details. SVG, HTML, Canvas, diagrams, and programmatic drawing are not substitutes for the final artwork.

## Selectable controls and inline parameters

When the host provides genuine interactive controls, the Skill prefers card-style selection: output modes and ordinary output sizes are multi-select, while copy mode and wallpaper relationship are single-select. Size choices include auto-fit, source aspect, 1:1, 3:4, 4:3, 4:5, 5:4, 2:3, 3:2, 9:16, 16:9, 21:9, 5:7, 7:5, and custom ratios or pixels. Without an interactive control, it falls back to a clear multiline numbered menu rather than showing fake checkboxes.

Every setting can also be supplied as an inline variable:

```text
/xxd-panel-045 photo.jpg --mode top-bottom,design-only --size auto,3:4,9:16 --text auto --locale ja-JP
```

Supported parameters include `--mode`, repeatable or comma-separated `--size`, `--text auto|custom|none`, `--locale`, `--copy`, `--wallpaper linked|independent`, `--wallpaper-size`, and `--out`. Complete parameters skip all preflight questions; partial parameters trigger only the missing questions. Different aspect ratios are independently recomposed, and the four-device wallpaper pack remains a separate branch rather than being multiplied by ordinary sizes.

## Image-model priority

GPT Image 2 is the default first choice. It keeps this project's established workflow: high-fidelity source reference, explicit whole-canvas selection before generation, one complete-canvas generation for paired modes, and scripted composition only as a conditional fallback.

Seedance 5.0 Pro, Nano Banana Pro (Gemini Image Pro), Nano Banana 2 (Gemini Image Flash), or another compatible bitmap model may also be used when it is actually available through the current tools or configured routes and can satisfy source fidelity, whole-canvas ratio, target-language text, and linked-wallpaper multi-reference requirements. An alternative changes only the generation route; it must not change modes, canvas, copy, locale, wallpaper relationship, or the complete-canvas-first strategy.

If no suitable route is available, the Skill asks the user to enable an image-generation tool or provide an API key. User-provided credentials may be used for the current task without being echoed, displayed, logged, or exposed. They are not persisted, and provider, account, billing, or global route configuration is not modified, unless the user explicitly requests that configuration change.
